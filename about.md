### Bio

Hey, nice to see you here. I'm an IT engineer who loves Data Science and Computer Vision. I'm gonna start my graduate study in January 2021. Until then I have super cool projects to work on and blogs to write. If you want to collaborate, don't hesitate to email me. My portfolio is my Github and Stack Overflow profile :)
